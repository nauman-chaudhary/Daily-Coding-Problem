#Daily-Coding-Problem  
Here are _my solutions_ to [__Daily Coding Problems__](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)  
Currently the Folders/files are numbered according to the problem number.  
There will be little to no description and dicussion of the solution, but I might add full-on discussions
later, or jupyter notebooks filled with explanations of approach used etc.  
In no way these solutions are to considered perfect, obviously I __will__ try to implement them as better
as I can, but afterall, I'm still learning.
